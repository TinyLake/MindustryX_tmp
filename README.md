### About MindustryX
Two Purpose:
* Add more useful apis to `core`, which can be use by mods/plugins.
* More features/optimizations for `server`.

All change should be compatible with official client.(can be optional with client support)  
This project will publish more frequently than the upstream.

### Build
This project will only release server builds.
Core api will be available in Jitpack.

If you'd rather compile on your own, `gradlew server:dist`.

### Version rule
`v144.102` match the upstream version `v144.1`, `02` is the MDTX patch version(begin with 1, reset each large version)

### Commit Tag
